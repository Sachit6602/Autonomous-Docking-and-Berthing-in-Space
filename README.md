# Autonomous Docking and Berthing in Space


The development of autonomous systems for rendezvous, docking, and berthing in space is essential for
developing space mission capabilities, particularly in solving challenges like docking operations and space
debris maintenance. This research explores the design, implementation, and evaluation of a completely autonomous docking system that utilizes advanced control algorithms and integrated sensor technologies in a
high-fidelity simulation environment. The work uses Gazebo and the Robot Operating System (ROS) to replicate space conditions, with Velodyne LiDAR and depth cameras added to improve spatial awareness. Three
control systems are used and evaluated for their effectiveness in moving spacecraft during docking operations:
proportional-integral-derivative (PID), linear quadratic regulator (LQR), and non-linear control. Optimizing
Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire (HCW) equations increases trajectory planning accuracy. The system’s performance
is examined under a variety of conditions, including debris avoidance, docking with orientation changes and
docking on different planes, to prove its durability and accuracy. The findings develop autonomous space
technology and provide better methods for future space missions.
